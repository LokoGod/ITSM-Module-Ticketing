GPT Guideline

1. Understand ITIL Basics First

Start by getting familiar with the core concepts of ITIL 4 (the latest version):

    Key Concepts:

        Service: Delivering value to customers without them managing specific costs/risks.

        Incident: An unplanned interruption or reduction in the quality of service.

        Request: User-generated service requests (e.g., password resets, software access).

        Problem: The cause of one or more incidents.

        Change: Addition/modification/removal of anything affecting IT services.

    Key Practices Relevant to a Ticketing System:

        Incident Management

        Service Request Management

        Problem Management

        Change Enablement

        Knowledge Management

        Service Level Management

    üìö Suggested Resource: Take the ITIL 4 Foundation course (Axelos certified or free alternatives like YouTube/LinkedIn Learning).

2. Define the Scope of Your Ticketing Module

Start small with a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) and expand as needed:

    Incident creation, categorization, and prioritization

    Assignment and escalation rules

    Status tracking and SLAs

    User and technician dashboards

    Basic reporting

Later you can add:

    Knowledge base integration

    Problem/change/request management

    Asset association

    Chat/Email integrations

3. Design Using ITIL-Aligned Workflows

Map out workflows that mirror ITIL practices:

    Incident Lifecycle: New ‚Üí Assigned ‚Üí In Progress ‚Üí Resolved ‚Üí Closed

    SLA Monitoring: Track response and resolution times based on priority

    Escalation Mechanisms: Time or priority-based escalations

4. Use ITIL Terminology in UI/UX

Naming conventions matter. Users and techs will feel more at home if you:

    Use terms like "Incident", "Service Request", "Problem", etc.

    Have status options like ‚ÄúPending User‚Äù, ‚ÄúWaiting for Vendor‚Äù, ‚ÄúResolved‚Äù

5. Collaborate With ITSM Pros or Forums

Even if you're building it solo, join:

    Reddit (r/sysadmin, r/ITIL)

    TechNet forums

    ITSM Slack/Discord communities

You'll get real-world feedback and use-case ideas.
6. Plan for Integrations Early

ITIL tools often tie in with:

    CMDB (Configuration Management Database)

    Email systems

    Monitoring tools

    Asset Management Plan API endpoints or modular design accordingly.

7. Document and Review

Write detailed documentation for each module you design, mapping it back to the ITIL framework where applicable. Review and iterate based on feedback or real-use testing.
